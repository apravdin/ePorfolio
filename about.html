        <h3>Hi there,</h3>
        <p class="blurb">My name is Anton Pravdin, I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Web Developement is my passion and I'm always looking for exciting projects to hone my skills. Feel free to send me an <a href="contact.html">email</a> for any reason, I always enjoy meeting new people.</p>

        <h3>A bit about myself</h3>
        <p>With a strong technical background and passion for innovation, my goal is to create unique and exceptional products with every project I embark on. It brings me great pleasure to be part of the constantly evolving technological community, which is why I love to work and share my knowledge with other talented individuals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>During the three years at the University of Waterloo I have studied a broad variety of topics (ex. security, operating systems, networking systems) which have established a solid foundation. With this knowledge I began to explore more distinct fields.<br><br>My first real experience of Web Development was during my work term for Points International. There I developed an automated testing framework which would simulate user interaction. This experience was a great learning opportunity, but something was missing.<br><br>It was at TulipRetail.ca where I truly realized my passion for Web Developement. TulipRetail being a startup company, allowed me the freedom to experiment and contribute to projects that interested me the most. Now with a clear view of my goals I am ready to take on new exciting web-related challenges.</p>

        <h3>This is who I am</h3>
        <p>For those who are interested in figuring out what makes me tick, this next part is for you.<br><br>I am Anton Sergeivich Pravdin born in Kazakhstan during the winter solstice. I have lived in several countries and involved myself with a vast variety of cultures. I have experienced the birth of the information age and saw the potential that it has to offer. I embrace change and thrive off risks, as they are chances at making something truly amazing.<br><br>My self awareness began roughly 14 years ago when I was at the age of six and had recently moved to a new country, Belarus. That moment was a significant change in my life that kick started my exploration and creativity side. During the few years that I lived there I learned a few valuable lessons. My competitive edge was born when I wrote an entrance “exam” to the top school in Minsk (capital of Belarus). I got in, at that moment I learned that it is possible to be “better”,  that there is something beyond the average, this feeling later drove me surpass my peers. At that time my family had almost no resources. As a result I grew up outdoors, I explored further and further away from home each day. I learned of an apple orchard that I could sneak into, and once I mastered climbing trees I had all the apples I ever wanted. At one point I learned that elementary students could ride on the transit system for free, which only increased the number of places that I could explore.<br><br>Things quickly settled down when I moved to Canada. For the majority of my primary education I continued to excel in most of my subjects yet failed to embrace my creative side. It was only during the last year in highschool that I gave up on conforming to society and realized that I had the opportunity to do anything I wanted. I soon learned that with a creative mindset it is possible  to solve any problem. At one point I tried to join the executing team of the UN club, unfortunately all the positions have been filled. Over a few weeks I managed to create a new position for myself, which gets filled every year ever since for some unknown reason.<br><br>With this attitude I begun my post secondary education. Within the few years at the University of Waterloo I have created a habit of questioning regulations. I have come to understand that there is always some purpose for any set of rules. With this understanding it is possible to completely disregard the norm as long as the intended purpose is still met.<br><br> I truly believe that in order to promote creativity and intellectual growth we must be willing to explore. We have to be willing to take the risks necessary to create something unique and extraordinary. Many people believe this message, but I live by it.</p>

        <h3>My Methodology</h3>
        <p>Here are a few more conclusions that I have made, that greatly influence my thoughts, decisions, and actions.<br><br>Minimal designs are absolutely fantastic, not only for web design but for everyday life. The way I see it is, with every new day there is more information that we have to process. Since processing information takes time, as a result time is becoming less readily available. By implementing minimal designs it is possible to display the same message through less resources. For example this paragraph could be written as follows:<br><p class="quote">data takes time to process<br>minimal designs display same message with less data<br>thus less time to process same message</p><br>Although this example is a fairly extreme case it is not so far off from the truth. Social media has already begun to implement more simple communication protocols, <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2007/02.html#d19t1813">here is great article</a> that compares IM to email and further demonstrates the importance of minimal designs.<br><br>Expanding on the idea above, I think that most knowledge is to some degree useless. Due to the sheer amount of information out there and the various situations that can befall someone, it should not be possible to be prepared for all the possibilities. I think we should treat our brain as a cache. Caches are generally small and store only the most relevant information, and so should our brain. Instead of attempting to learn a broad topic it is more beneficial to understand just the underlying concept. I believe that creative and analytical thinking is much more effective than factual thinking since it scales better to solve any number of problems.<br><br>Of course there are many more deciding factors in my methodology, but at this point I hope that I demonstrated that I am a very analytical individual. There are virtually no actions that I perform without a significant thought process.
